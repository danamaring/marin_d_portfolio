# INTEGRATED ASSIGNMENT: Hosted Portfolio Website
The portfolio site you develop this term is ultimately what you will use to present your work and your skillset (as designers and/or developers) to potential clients and employers. As such, the design and presentation of that design is up to you entirely, within the technical parameters listed below. Your final portfolio site will incorporate your logo and build upon the interface/branding designs you develop in Electronic Image and Production.

## Description

The ‘look and feel’ of the site needs to be consistent with the branding approach developed in your Electronic Image Production class so that your Web presence is consistent with your style guide and identity etc.

Specifically, in regards to the Web technologies presented in your web class, your final site has to include an HTML5 mobile-first responsive layout, with CSS3 elements (animation, transitions etc) used to whatever extent they can be.

All dynamic content including copy and graphics/video must be fetched from a database and rendered to the page. Each site will also require a functioning PHP mail form as a way of contacting the site owner.

Use Javascript to create some additional features on your site. You MUST build some type of gallery for your portfolio work that uses your own custom functionality. Your gallery feature should show the selected portfolio item with descriptive text, larger image/video and optionally link out to a live page (if the portfolio piece is a standalone website).
